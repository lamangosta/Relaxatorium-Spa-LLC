<h3>Meet your Massage Therapist</h3>
    <p>Meet Dee: She has been working in the field of massage therapy as an LMT(Licensed Massage Therapist) since 1999.
       She has received numerous awards, and the commendation of her peers. Her client's rave about her service, and many have followed her over the years
       as she has worked at various spas throughout the contiguous United States, and Hawaii.</p> 

       <p>Meet Sergio: Sergio is an <u>LMT</u> who has traveled the world with some of the most prestigious cruise line.
          He prides himself on being in tune with the bodies anatomy, and contributes this to his success
          as a therapist. He says, "Knowing the anatomy of the body has helped me to be successful as a massage therapist. When you understand the body
          you can understand your client, and when you understand your client you can provide excellent personal care catered to each customer!"
        </p>

     <p>Meet T: With over 25 years of experience as an LMT, she enjoys helping her client's to recooperate after long hard days at work. She feels a person can get
        the most benefit from massage therapy, if they take an overall approach to living a healthy life and caring for the body.</p>
